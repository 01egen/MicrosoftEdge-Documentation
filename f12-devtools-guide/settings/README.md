**Inspect Element** and **View Source** are no longer shown by default in the Microsoft Edge context menu (opened when right-clicking on a web page). To enable these context menu items, you can either:

- Open the Microsoft Edge F12 developer tools by pressing the F12 key or from the more (`...`) menu.
- Change the Developer Settings by visiting about:flags and checking to `Show "View Source" and "Inspect Element" in the context menu`, as illustrated below.
