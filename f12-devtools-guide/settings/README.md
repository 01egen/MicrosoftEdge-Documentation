# Settings for the Edge Developer Tools

## Inspect Element & View Source Context Menus
[Applies to Windows Insider Builds after 14328.]

The context menu items to open the F12 developer tools are no longer shown by default in Edge. To enable the context menu items, you can either:

* Open the F12 Edge developer tools by pressing the F12 key or from the more (`...`) menu.
* In the Edge about:flags page the options can be shown by checking the setting `Show "View Source" and "Inspect Element" in the context menu`, as illustrated below.
