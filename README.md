# README

This is the GitHub repository for Microsoft Edge documentation for http://dev.modern.ie

At the mooment, both MS Edge and IE developer content still live in MSDN Library at https://msdnstage.redmond.corp.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh772401(v=vs.85).aspx
We are working to port the MS Edge-related topics and resources here, as well as exclusively author any new content (e.g., extensions) here.

##Format for adding new Docs and Links


  - Docs are grouped by folders
  - A folder can contain more folders or a readme.md
  - one .md file per folder
  - links should be formatted as: ../Perfomance/  (not ../Perfomance/ReadMe.md)
